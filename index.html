  Maheshwar
</h4>
<p>
  Maheshwar is a historic town located in the Khargone district of Madhya Pradesh, India, situated along the northern banks of the sacred Narmada River. Approximately 91 kilometers southwest of Indore, Maheshwar is renowned for its rich cultural heritage, architectural marvels, and traditional handloom industry.​
  </p>

    Historically known as Mahishmati, Maheshwar finds mention in ancient Indian epics like the Ramayana and Mahabharata. It served as the capital of King Kartavirya Arjuna, also known as Sahasrarjun. According to legend, Sahasrarjun once halted the flow of the Narmada River with his thousand arms, creating a playground for his wives. During this time, the demon king Ravana is said to have established a Shivalinga on the riverbank.
